# Foolish Division Backend
An Open Source Alternative to Splitwise.

~[Frontend Repository](https://github.com/kb3vwt/Foolish-Division-Frontend)~ (Not ready yet)

## Development
This project is in an early state. This uses a Django backend with a ReactJS frontend. ~Currently, this is being 
deployed to Render @ [www.foolish-division.com](https://www.foolish-division.com).~ Local development should use the
dev.yml Docker Compose to set up the backend and manually launch the frontend in a separate process.

The current state of the code is "Get it working". Cleanup and security enhancements (beyond basic JWT authentication classes) will occur once proved out.
